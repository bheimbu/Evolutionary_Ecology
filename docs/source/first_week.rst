First week
==========
In the first week, you will see, separate and determine oribatid mites and process them in the molecular lab to obtain DNA sequences for phylogenetic analyses.

Goals
--------------
.. note::
	**You will…**
	  - gain basic knowledge of oribatid mites’ ecology, evolution, phylogeny and body plans.
	  - realize that their body plan is often linked with their taxonomy and phylogeny.
	  - will understand how to distinguish oribatid mites from other soil-fauna and other mites.
	  - will be able to recognize the most relevant and useful morphological characters to separate oribatid mites into major groups.
	  - be able to determine oribatid mites to genus, if possible even to species level, using a determination key.
	  - be able to organise your collected and determined material within a team, which includes labelling and keeping a common list updated.
	  - learn how DNA extraction works step by step and you will be able to tell properties of the most relevant chemical substances that are essential for DNA extraction.
	  - be able to explain how a PCR works and how to visualize the results.
	  - be able to tell the differences between the different genes (markers) we will use for the PCRs.
	  - understand how Sanger sequencing works, why we are using it in this course and how to prepare samples for Sanger sequencing.

Day 1
-----
You already know, how to collect soil animals. In the morning, we start with a general introduction to the soil fauna. In the afternoon, we work with oribatid mites only. And at the end of the day, you have a collection of different mite species, roughly divided into distinct morphological types (morphotypes).
In the morning, you will have a general introduction into soil animal systematics and meet the most common representatives to make you familiar with the term “mesofauna”.
You will also receive an introduction to the taxonomy and phylogeny of oribatid mites and learn more about their characteristic body plans and lifestyles, which will help you to distinguish oribatid mites from other mites.
In the afternoon, you will see the soil fauna with your own eyes through a stereomicroscope. While many of the soil animals will be dead in your samples, all oribatid mites and other taxa, will be alive. Oribatid mites are a very diverse group, ranging from fast runners to very slow movers; from tiny transparent ones to large, pitch-black species. Some species are smooth as glass, others are covered in dirt. However, all oribatid mites have in common an extensive arsenal of defense strategies.

.. tip::
   Take your time to observe oribatid mites and their characteristic movements and bodies. Write down three to five features (morphological and/or behavioural) of three living oribatid mites you observe. Remember, a character is everything you can observe. What type of defense strategy do the different oribatids display? Save your notes, we will use them later in this course. It may be helpful to make drawings or sketches of the observed species to more easily distinguish morphotypes based on certain character(s).

.. note::
  **At the end of the day, you will be able to recognize the most relevant morphological characters to:**
    - separate oribatid mites from other mites
    - sort oribatid mites into major groups
    - to sort oribatid mite species into groups of morphotypes
    - determine oribatid mites to genus, and maybe to species level.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. important::
	  - Sort oribatid mites by morphotypes. You can collect over 10 different morphotypes, at least two are required (use glass dishes filled with ethanol).
	  - At the end of the day, transfer each morphogroup (all individuals belonging to the same morphotype) into a separate vial.
	  - Transfer one or two individuals (depending on your total number) in a glass vial and add a small label.
	  - The remaining individuals (up to eight or more, at least one ore two are required depending on your total number) go into 2 ml tubes. Label them in the same way as the samples in the glass vials.
	  - Write down three to five characters (morphological and/or behavioural) of three oribatid mite species. Keep your notes, we will be using them later in this course.

Feedback Day 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To provide feedback, please complete our questionnaire: [Questionnaire Link](https://www.example.com/questionnaire).

.. tip::
   Just in case, you can watch the :ref:`lectures` again at any time.

Day 2
-----
Goals
^^^^^
Yesterday, you collected oribatid mites that were slowly cooking in lactic acid over night to brighten them for better examination under the microscope. Without this treatment, it would be impossible to recognize important morphological features.

.. note::
  **Today, you will…**
    - deepen your knowledge about how to determine oribatid mites.
    - learn to recognise additional morphological characters.
    - be able to determine most of your specimen to species level.

For the species level identification (using the microscope), please remove one or two individuals from the glass vials; the remaining specimen (in 2 ml reaction tubes) are used for molecular work.

Summary
^^^^^^^
**Yesterday**, you gained an overview about soil-biodiversity and the most common mesofauna representatives. Today we got a deeper insight into the fascinating world of body shapes and forms that are so characteristic of oribatid mites. You are also familiar with the 'morphotype' concept and able to recognize families and genera of oribatid mites, in some case down to to the species level, by form, shape, and individual characters.
**Today** your task is to determine at the species level the morphotypes you collected yesterday (if you didn't do so yesterday). Use only one individual from your morphotype collection and leave the others untouched. Please enter all species you have identified in a common taxa list, including the number of morphotypes.
**At the end of the day**, the entire class will have a shared collection of oribatid mite species of specific morphotypes; you learned how to label and organise samples and intermediate results (i.e., your shared taxa list) in a transparent and unique way.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. important::
    1. Please enter the sample number, species name, morphotype number, and your name in the common taxa list.
    2. At the end of the day, everyone should have five different species identified.

Question of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. important::
    Why will we use the undetermined morphospecies for molecular work?
