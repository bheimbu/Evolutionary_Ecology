First week
==========
In the first week, you will see, separate and determine oribatid mites and process them in the molecular lab to obtain DNA sequences for phylogenetic analyses.

Aims of week 1
--------------
You will…

  - gain basic knowledge of oribatid mites’ ecology, evolution, phylogeny and body plans.
  - realize that their body plan is often linked with their taxonomy and phylogeny.
  - will understand how to distinguish oribatid mites from other soil-fauna and other mites.
  - will be able to recognize the most relevant and useful morphological characters to separate oribatid mites into major groups.
  - be able to determine oribatid mites to genus, if possible even to species level, using a determination key.
  - be able to organise your collected and determined material within a team, which includes labelling and keeping a common list updated.
  - learn how DNA extraction works step by step and you will be able to tell properties of the most relevant chemical substances that are essential for DNA extraction.
  - be able to explain how a PCR works and how to visualize the results.
  - be able to tell the differences between the different genes (markers) we will use for the PCRs.
  - understand how Sanger sequencing works, why we are using it in this course and how to prepare samples for Sanger sequencing.

Day 1
^^^^^
**Overview:**
You already know, how to collect soil animals. In the morning, we start with a general introduction to the soil fauna. In the afternoon, we work with oribatid mites only. And at the end of the day, you have a collection of different mite species, roughly divided into distinct morphological types (morphotypes).

**Part One:**
In the morning, you will have a general introduction into soil animal systematics and meet the most common representatives.
You will get familiar with the term “mesofauna”.
You will also receive an introduction to the taxonomy and phylogeny of oribatid mites and learn more about their characteristic body plans and lifestyles, which will help you to distinguish oribatid mites from other mites.

**Part Two:**

In the afternoon, we will see soil fauna with your own eyes through a stereomicroscope. While many of the soil animals will be dead in your samples, all oribatid mites and other taxa, will be alive. Oribatid mites are a very diverse group, ranging from fast runners to very slow movers; from tiny transparent ones to large, pitch-black species. Some species are smooth as glass, others are covered in dirt. However, all oribatid mites have in common an extensive arsenal of defense strategies.

Take your time to observe oribatid mites and their characteristic movements and bodies. Write down three to five features (morphological and/or behavioural) of three living oribatid mites you observe. Remember, a character is everything you can observe. What type of defense strategy do the different oribatids display? Save your notes, we will use them later in this course. Tip: It may be helpful to make drawings or sketches of the observed species to more easily distinguish morphotypes based on certain character(s).
 
**At the end of the day, you will be able to recognize the most relevant morphological characters to:**
  - separate oribatid mites from other mites
  - sort oribatid mites into major groups
  - to sort oribatid mite species into groups of morphotypes
  - determine oribatid mites to genus, and maybe to species level.
