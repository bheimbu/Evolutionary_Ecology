.. note::

  Each project-team will build their own hypothesis and collect data, from the course and public repositories, to answer the research question. You will apply the suitable analytical tools and interpret your results in a scientific context. This will be presented by you and discussed (and defended) with the whole group.

.. attention::

  The course will end with the last presentation and a feedback round on Friday. You will not have to write a protocol or paper. Instead, you will have to answer a questionnaire, individually, on Thursday.
