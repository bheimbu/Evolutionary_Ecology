Introduction
============

Hello and welcome again to M.Biodiv411 Evolutionary Ecology. This Master's course will introduce you into the amazing world of little creatures called oribatid mites. In the next three weeks, you will learn a lot about them and how to work with them in the lab.

But first things first, who are the people behind this course actually...

First, there is Ina and I am your tutor in this course. I am working as a postdoc in the department of Animal Ecology and have been working with molecular data of soil organisms for many years, focusing on the evolution of small soil arthropods. This is an exciting field, because many evolutionary concepts developed from well studied above ground systems have been transfered to the soil, presuming that it works the same below the ground. But this is not necessarily true. Soil differs from the above ground system in some important respects and I hope you will figure out some of these differences yourself during this course. However, the basic concepts of evolution are universal, but if basic conditions vary, evolution can take idiosyncratic courses. The world we see today is a result of chances and constraints.
Therefore I find it important that you understand your modelsystem (habitat, organism) to find reasonable research questions and to be able to interpret your research data.

Second, there is Bastian...

Course Structure
----------------

.. note::
  The course structure reflects that of a mini research project.

In the :ref:`first-week` you will learn about the soil systems and deal with some of its inhabitants. You will collect mites (see :ref:`how-to-sample`) and determine them with the help of a stereomicroscope. The collected mites will also be used for DNA extraction and sequencing.

During the :ref:`second-week`, you will learn the most important tools to analyse molecular data and you will get an introduction into the basics of molecular phyogenetics. Phylogenetics can be a very helpful tool to structure your data and to investigate open research questions.

The :ref:`third-week` is dedicated to you and your own :ref:`Mini_research_Project`. In the first two weeks you will learn everything to come up with your own research question. You will collect your own data (:ref:`first-week`), and learn how to use public databases, as well as methods for investigating a scientific hypothesis (:ref:`second-week`). You will work together in groups -- small research teams --, to delegate and organise your research project efficiently. At the last day of the course, you will present your :ref:_`Mini_research_Project`.
