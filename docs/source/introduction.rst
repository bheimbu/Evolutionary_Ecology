Introduction
============

Hello and welcome to M.Biodiv.441: Evolutionary Ecology. This master's course introduces you to the fascinating world of oribatid mites. Over the next three weeks, you will delve into the unique characteristics of these tiny creatures. Oribatid mites play a crucial role in soil ecosystems worldwide, which differ significantly from above-ground ecosystems in several key ways. While many evolutionary concepts were initially developed from well-studied above-ground systems, they have often been applied to soil ecosystems under the assumption that the same principles hold true. However, this is not always the case. Although fundamental evolutionary concepts are universal, the specific evolutionary trajectories in soil ecosystems can diverge under different conditions. In this course, we hope you will uncover and appreciate some of these distinct evolutionary pathways.

But first, let’s introduce the team behind this course...

**First**, we have **Bastian**, a postdoc in the Department of Animal Ecology and head of the molecular lab. His primary research focuses on termites from the Australian continent, where he explores their evolutionary history through phylogenetic and biogeographic methods. Bastian also brings expertise in genomics, microbiomics, and bioinformatics.

**Second**, we have **Johanna**, she is a PhD student in the Department of Animal Ecology. Her research, part of the Biodiversity Exploratories, focuses on community phylogenetics to understand the assembly processes of oribatid mites and their response to disturbances like forest gap formation. By using molecular and trait-based approaches, she aims to explore how these changes affect ecosystem functions and services, providing insight into potential future ecosystem shifts.

Course Structure
----------------

.. note::
  The course structure reflects that of a mini research project.

In the :ref:`first-week` you will learn about the soil systems and deal with some of its inhabitants. You will collect mites (see :ref:`how-to-sample` ⛏ ) and determine them with the help of a stereomicroscope. The collected mites will also be used for DNA extraction and sequencing.

During the :ref:`second-week`, you will learn the most important tools to analyse molecular data and you will get an introduction into the basics of molecular phyogenetics. Phylogenetics can be a very helpful tool to structure your data and to investigate open research questions.

The :ref:`third-week` is dedicated to you and your own :ref:`Mini_research_Project`. In the first two weeks you will learn everything to come up with your own research question. You will collect your own data (:ref:`first-week`), and learn how to use public databases, as well as methods for investigating a scientific hypothesis (:ref:`second-week`). You will work together in groups -- small research teams --, to delegate and organise your research project efficiently. At the last day of the course, you will present your :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.
