Introduction
============

Hello and welcome to M.Biodiv.441: Evolutionary Ecology. This master's course introduces you to the fascinating world of oribatid mites. Over the next three weeks, you will delve into the unique characteristics of these tiny creatures. Oribatid mites play a crucial role in soil ecosystems worldwide, which differ significantly from above-ground ecosystems in several key ways. While many evolutionary concepts were initially developed from well-studied above-ground systems, they have often been applied to soil ecosystems under the assumption that the same principles hold true. However, this is not always the case. Although fundamental evolutionary concepts are universal, the specific evolutionary trajectories in soil ecosystems can diverge under different conditions. In this course, we hope you will uncover and appreciate some of these distinct evolutionary pathways.

But first, let’s introduce the team behind this course...

**First**, we have **Bastian**, a postdoc in the Department of Animal Ecology and head of the molecular lab. His primary research focuses on termites from the Australian continent, where he explores their evolutionary history through phylogenetic and biogeographic methods. Bastian also brings expertise in genomics, microbiomics, and bioinformatics.

**Second**, we have **Johanna**, she is a PhD student in the Department of Animal Ecology. Her research, part of the Biodiversity Exploratories, focuses on community phylogenetics to understand the assembly processes of oribatid mites and their response to disturbances like forest gap formation. By using molecular and trait-based approaches, she aims to explore how these changes affect ecosystem functions and services, providing insight into potential future ecosystem shifts.

Course Structure
----------------

.. note::
  The course is structured like a :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.

In the :ref:`first-week`, you will explore soil systems and their inhabitants. You’ll collect mites (see :ref:how-to-sample ⛏) and identify them using a stereomicroscope. The collected mites will also be used for DNA extraction and sequencing.

In the :ref:`second-week`, you will learn essential tools for analyzing molecular data and be introduced to the fundamentals of molecular phylogenetics. Phylogenetics is a valuable tool for structuring data and exploring research questions.

The :ref:`third-week` is dedicated to your own :ref:`Mini_research_Project`. By the end of the first two weeks, you will have the knowledge to develop your own research question. You will collect your own data (:ref:`first-week`), utilize public databases, and apply methods to investigate a scientific hypothesis (:ref:`second-week`). Working in small research teams, you will efficiently organize and delegate tasks within your project. On the final day of the course, you will present your :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.
