Introduction
============

Hello and welcome again to M.Biodiv411 Evolutionary Ecology. This Master's course will introduce you into the amazing world of little creatures called oribatid mites. In the next three weeks, you will learn a lot about them and how to work with them in the lab.
This is an exciting field because many evolutionary concepts developed from well-studied above-ground systems have been transferred to soil systems with the assumption that this works the same way underground. Yet this is not necessarily true. The soil differs from the above-ground system in several important ways, and we hope you will discover some of these differences for yourself in this course. However, the basic concepts of evolution are universal, but when the framework conditions vary, evolution can take idiosyncratic courses. The world we see today is a result of chances and constraints...

But first things first, who are the people behind this course...

First, there is Ina. She is currently a postdoc at the Senckenberg Institute in Frankfurt working in the `Functional Environmental Genomics <https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/sbik-f/functional-environmental-genomics/>`_ research group, before that she worked as a postdoc in the department of Animal Ecology. Ina has been working with molecular data of soil organisms for many years, focusing on the evolution of small soil arthropods, but has also worked with earthworms from Northern America.

Second, there is Bastian. He's a postdoc in the department of Animal Ecology and head of the mollilab. His main focus are termites from the Australian continent, where he tries to understand their evolutionary history using phylogenetic and biogeographic techniques. He is also experienced in genomics and microbiomics.

Course Structure
----------------

.. note::
  The course structure reflects that of a mini research project.

In the :ref:`first-week` you will learn about the soil systems and deal with some of its inhabitants. You will collect mites (see :ref:`how-to-sample`) and determine them with the help of a stereomicroscope. The collected mites will also be used for DNA extraction and sequencing.

During the :ref:`second-week`, you will learn the most important tools to analyse molecular data and you will get an introduction into the basics of molecular phyogenetics. Phylogenetics can be a very helpful tool to structure your data and to investigate open research questions.

The :ref:`third-week` is dedicated to you and your own :ref:`Mini_research_Project`. In the first two weeks you will learn everything to come up with your own research question. You will collect your own data (:ref:`first-week`), and learn how to use public databases, as well as methods for investigating a scientific hypothesis (:ref:`second-week`). You will work together in groups -- small research teams --, to delegate and organise your research project efficiently. At the last day of the course, you will present your :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.
