Geneious Prime is a molecular biology and sequence analysis tool, and helps you to organize data and projects in an efficient way.

  .. note::
  It is important that the consensus sequences are of high quality (checked for sequencing errors or true heterozygosity) and that ambiguous positions are removed in order to infer correct phylogenies. Standard Sanger sequencing methods produce DNA sequences of ~700-900 bp long, however ~30 bp at the start/end of the sequence is usally of poor quality. This is due to primer deterioration, incorrect primer annealing, and/or aborted elongation, as well as technical limitations in accurately separating very short and very long DNA strands at the nucleotide level.
  To obtain high quality consensus sequences, it is common to sequence and assemble the forward and reverse strands of a PCR product. In this way it is possible to correct ambigous positions. Furthermore, by assembling forward and reverse sequences, the resulting consensus sequence is usually longer than any single strand, thus providing more phylogenetic information.
  Sequencing facilities normally provide raw sequencing data in .abi format (also known as DNA trace file). This file contains the DNA sequence electropherogram as well as raw data. The electropherogram (=chromatogram) shows the DNA trace during the sequencing process and can be viewed graphically.
  Most sequencing editors can open .abi trace files, such as BioEdit. However, most sequencing editors and analyses software that combine the DNA sequence and the chromatogram in a single analysis window, which considerably simplifies the processing of sequences, are commercial (e.g. Sequencher, CodonCodeAligner) .
  Geneious Prime (Biomatters) provides a 30-day trial version, which we will use for analysing the sequences generated last week. You can download Geneious Prime `here <https://manage.geneious.com/free-trial>`_ and install it on your PC.
